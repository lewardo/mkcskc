# mkcskc
## c looks good, but it could look better!  
### current global additions
+ negated conditions with `ifnt` and `whilnt`
+ ranged loop for for loops, just very useful

### c-specific additions
+ void pointer dereferencer to keep all the ugly casting in one place

### cpp-specific additions
+ renamed `std::unordered_map` to `hashmap`, so much clearer for beginners
